# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Reflection
- This challenge wasn't too bad took me around 45mins to complete, I do think that having the design files make styling much easier and more enjoyable than having to do it yourself.

## Things to Improve on going forward
- I think I need to review and refine my responsive design knowledge.
- I think I rely more on flexbox to align things, and maybe I should be more cognisant of that and use other tools as well.
- Spacing is another thing that is a bit challenging sometimes, I think i struggle a little bit when to use width/height or min-width/height or when to use padding and margin etc.
